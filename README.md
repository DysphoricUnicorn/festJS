# fest.js
fest.js is an in development library for testing JavaScript + React code

## Why the name?

This name is a combination of the words fast and test as well as the shorthand for JavaScript.  
If you combine fast and test in the way I did for the name, you also end up with a German word that means two things:  
  1. fest (adjective): Solid (something that tests should be to avoid them failing in "hickups"  
  2. Fest (noun): Celebration (something you might want to do after you have found a library that reduces your test runtime while also increasing test stability)  

## Current status

As you might see, there is not any code in this library yet.  
That is because I have not actually developed it at this point.  
I was just getting so frustrated at the state of JavaScript + React testing that I chose to build my own library.  
I didn't have time to write any code for it yet, but I came up with a name that for some reason is not taken yet (at least a quick google search didn't turn anything up) and makes a lot of sense for what this should become.

Stay tuned for more!
